I often change OS and I have to everytime clone someone config and customize it for myself.
But I decided just save it. This configurations are created by another developers, not by me!

oh yeah, you to install:
1. nvim 
2. tmux
3. alacritty

# I use keyboard -> Keychron k2 on ubuntu
and to active the f1, f2, f3... keys,
you need to just follow the guide:)
